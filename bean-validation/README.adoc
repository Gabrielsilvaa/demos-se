= Bean Validation sample

In the sample exploring bean validation and JNoSQL, the application uses MongoDB as a database, but we can use any database instance instead.

To run this project a MongoDB instance is required, so you can use either a local installation or using Docker.

== Manual installation

Follow the instructions in: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/

== Using Docker

* Install docker: https://www.docker.com/
* https://store.docker.com/images/mongo
* Run docker command
* Run MongoDB: verify MongoDB image name with the command `docker images`, it can be mongodb or mongo, and then execute this command:
** `docker run -d --name mongodb-instance -p 27017:27017 mongo`

== Run the code

With a MongoDB instance running go to the class **App** and have fun.
