**ArangoDB**: ArangoDB is a native multi-model database system[1] developed by triAGENS GmbH. The database system supports three important data models (key/value, documents, graphs) with one database core and a unified query language AQL (ArangoDB Query Language). The query language is declarative and allows the combination of different data access patterns in a single query. ArangoDB is a NoSQL database system but AQL is similar in many ways to SQL.
